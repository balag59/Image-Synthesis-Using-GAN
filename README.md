# IMAGE SYNTHESIS USING GAN
An end to end model that can synthesize images from a given text using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks).
There are currently two GAN architectures in this repository, and both work on the MNSIT dataset.

# Conditional GAN using fully connected layers only:
gan_fc.py
This is a conditional GAN that can generate the desired hand-written digit from 0 to 9.
#

# Vannila GAN:
gan_vanilla.py
This is a vanilla GAN that can a distribution of hand-written digits almost identical to that of the MNSIT dataset
